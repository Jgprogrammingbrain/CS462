The smart parking management system is a web-based smart parking management dashboard designed to monitor and optimize parking lot utilization. The system was built to combat the underutilisation of dedicated EV slots. The system features dynamic allocation tracking between Electric Vehicles (EV) and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, providing real-time visibility into slot availability and charging status.

Key Features

<br>**Occupancy Analytics:** Automatically calculates total capacity, occupancy percentages, and specific metrics for EV zones
<br>**Dynamic Allocation:** Distinguishes between regular and EV-specific zones to manage parking spot allocation
<br>**Notification System:** Email notifications shall there be any parking violations
<br><br>
Visual Status Indicators:
