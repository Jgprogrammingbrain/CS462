The smart parking management system is a web-based smart parking management dashboard designed to monitor and optimize parking lot utilization. The system was built to combat the underutilisation of dedicated EV slots. The system features dynamic allocation tracking between Electric Vehicles (EV) and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, providing real-time visibility into slot availability and charging status.

Key Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks parking slot occupancy with automated updates from IoT sensors for current time and status
Occupancy Analytics: Automatically calculates total capacity, occupancy percentages, and specific metrics for EV zones
Dynamic Allocation: Distinguishes between regular and EV-specific zones to manage parking spot allocation
Notification System: Email notifications shall there be any parking violations

Visual Status Indicators:
Available: Empty slots ready for use.
Occupied: Slots currently in use by ICE or EV vehicles
EV-Charging: Dedicated EV slots where charging is currently active
ICE-to-Vacate: Non-EV vehicles that have parked in EV zones during restricted timings and have been notified to vacate
